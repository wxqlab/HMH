# Unsupervised Similarity Search via Hierarchical Manifold Hashing
The code of our paper "Unsupervised Similarity Search via Hierarchical Manifold Hashing".

## Overview
![](https://github.com/Xiaoqin-Wang/HMH/blob/master/framework.png)
The framework of our HMH model, CNN features are extracted as input data of our model. We hierarchically construct the first- and second-layer manifolds, and then obtain similarity matrices ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?S)
