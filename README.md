# Unsupervised Similarity Search via Hierarchical Manifold Hashing (TKDE 2021)
The code of our paper "Unsupervised Similarity Search via Hierarchical Manifold Hashing".

## Overview
![](https://github.com/Xiaoqin-Wang/HMH/blob/master/framework.png)
The framework of our HMH model, CNN features are extracted as input data of our model. We hierarchically construct the first- and second-layer manifolds, and then obtain similarity matrices S and Z. Two matrices S and Z are harmonized into a tight layer-to-layer hash function. Finally, the data distribution of the original manifold space M can be embedded into the Hamming space H by the proposed hierarchical manifold learning.
